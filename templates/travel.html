    <h1>Getting There</h1>
    <p>The Anacortes ferry terminal is a 2-hour drive north from Seatac airport, then it's an extremely pretty 45-minute ferry ride from Anacortes to Orcas Island. Once you're on the island, the farm and town are both only a few miles from the ferry terminal.</p>

    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The ferry is prone to running late and occasionally gets canceled. We strongly encourage you to get to the island on Friday so you don't miss the wedding on Saturday. Additionally, ferry reservations can book up on busy summer weekends. We recommend reserving tickets as soon as the summer sailing schedule is released (sometime in April).</p>

    <p>Having a car will help you make the most of your time on Orcas, but if you aren't able to get a vehicle reservation, we'll do some shuttling/carpooling on the island. There is a big parking lot at the ferry terminal in Anacortes where you'll be able to leave your car.  If you don't have a car, you can call Terry Mullan for rides to your accommodations from the ferry terminal on Orcas (360-298-8414). </p>

    <p>Alternatively, for our sailor friends, the farm has a mooring buoy right in the cove. Give us a heads up if you're interested in sailing to the venue! You can rent and sail from Anacortes. </p>
